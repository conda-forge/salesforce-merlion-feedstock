  summary: A Machine Learning Framework for Time Series Intelligence
  license: BSD-3-Clause

  description: |
    Merlion is a Python library for time series intelligence. It
     features a unified interface for many commonly used models and
     datasets for anomaly detection and forecasting on both univariate
     and multivariate time series, along with standard pre-processing
     and post-processing layers. It has several modules to improve
     ease-of-use, including visualization, anomaly score calibration to
     improve interpetability, AutoML for hyperparameter tuning and model
     selection, and model ensembling. Merlion also provides a unique
     evaluation framework that simulates the live deployment and
     re-training of a model in production. This library aims to provide
     engineers and researchers a one-stop solution to rapidly develop
     models for their specific time series needs, and benchmark them
     across multiple time series datasets.
